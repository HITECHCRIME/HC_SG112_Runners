## Lyrics

```
brute FORCE, got no BACKup
gotta run ahead of MOST
mind it’s not the SPOTlight
that i’m after coz i’d rather
die than glow

in the shadows for that sake (matters)
with no blows to the head
i’ve put no mark up 
for what counts as a threat

what i’m passing no matter the cost
deliver the outcome
with as little force often
found it’s too much
to repay the latter at the all time low
treated like a dog of pavlov’s
to repay the sweat with blood 


this transaction
is already done
already closed

no blood

all the fucking raw force
all you’ve got ya

this transaction
is already done
already closed

no blood

all the fucking raw force
all you’ve got ya

brute FORCE, got no BACKup
gotta run ahead of MOST
mind it’s not the SPOTlight
that i’m after coz i’d rather
die than glow

```
