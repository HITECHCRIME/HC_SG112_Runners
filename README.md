## Lyrics

```
brute FORCE, got no BACKup
gotta run ahead of MOST
mind it’s not the SPOTlight
that i’m after coz i’d rather
die than glow

in the shadows for that sake (matters)
with no blows to the head
i’ve put no mark up 
for what counts as a threat (death)
coz
what i’m passing no matter the cost
deliver(s) the outcome
with as little force often
found it’s too much
to repay the latter at the all time low
treated like a dog of pavlov’s
to repay the sweat with blood 


this transaction
is already done
already closed

no blood

all the fucking raw force
all you’ve got ya

this transaction
is already done
already closed

no blood

all the fucking raw force
all you’ve got ya

brute FORCE, got no BACKup
gotta run ahead of MOST
mind it’s not the SPOTlight
that i’m after coz i’d rather
die than glow

```

## Notes

## Music Video

hitech runners / last shot is a Polish rundown bus stop
human comes back to a home lab where it put itself in a machine but first pulls by a tiny strand of hair growing at the top of the skull that reveals itself to be a reinforced cable, which when pulled initiates the core retrieval procedure sliding the vertical cylinder containing all the data about the person inside to simulate behaviour. anyway, the human surrogate clone is being sliced into 4 pieces like a cross from top to  down using a square machine with lasers. As the pieces unfold the parts of the head flop to the corners and the core cylinder remains in the air held with a robotic arm. Now the cylinder is leaving its position and it is driven into a horizontal docking station near some blacked out windows (exact shape hole), the light turns green as it gets inserted - steam comes out. we continue to follow the path of the high bandwidth data transfer as it reaches the head of a real human connected cerebrally to a PC using N1(8) technology (Elon Musk but future evolution). The human looks the same as the clone 100%. As he severs the connection and intakes the sensoric memory of the clone (he was inhabiting the mind but not the body, data of which cannot be transferred in realtime due to raw overload it could inflict upon the real human mind) he looks up to the screens where we can see that the real world is run over by real human bots who creepily stare blankly ahead and progress with their "lives". The actual humans send out clones that are replicas of themselves to observe the enslavement. They call them runners. The thing is the runners behave similar to the human bots to blend in so there is actually no telling if there are any other runners out there still operating and how many operators have survived. Phew, ok.
